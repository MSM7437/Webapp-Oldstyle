# Webapp-Oldstyle
Group Project 1 - Deploy a Webapp/Oldstyle - ITSV 412

The class will be divided into groups of 4â€“6 students each. These groups will be split into Dev and Ops teams. 
Each group is responsible to deliver a running webapp of your choice (examples: https://wordpress.org,Links to an external site. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki,Links to an external site. 
https://gohugo.io,Links to an external site. https://jekyllrb.com,Links to an external site. https://getnikola.com,Links to an external site. http://getpelican.comLinks to an external site., etc) by the due date. 
The application must be modified in some way so that the appearance of the interface is visibly different from the default code as published on GitHub.com. 
Additionally, you will need to create some content that is transferred between the dev and production environments. 
There should be at least three pages with original content in the final product.

RULES:

The Dev team is responsible for any coding. They will make the necessary alterations to the interface design, and also create the content that will be duplicated in the production environment.
The Ops team is responsible to create and manage the production environment that will host the Python app (including OS and any required dependencies, like storage or databases). This can be done on a local machine to which you have access (like a laptop), or using another server to which you have access (like a VM from Google Cloud Platform or AWS).
The Dev team cannot touch the production boxes. 
The Ops team must take the prepared application and related data from the Dev team and deploy it, and the result must match what the Dev team sees on their development environment (both the production and development environments will be examined to judge success).
Both teams will be assigned a leader from within the team. Cross-team communication may only happen via email, and only through each team leader: no direct conversations between Dev and Ops team members!
